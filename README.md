# btcusd-exchange app

This project returns the current rate for bitcoin and USD. Demo is available at https://btcusd-exchange.herokuapp.com/.

### What did you find most challenging? How did you overcome it?

The most challenging for me is that I'm not very familiar with some operations like deploying this app to Heroku and retrieval data from an unknown API. Besides, it also takes some time to debug this application.

When I encountered some problems, I searched online to find how to deal with these problems. In addition, I would like to think how to solve them in another way which may avoid this problem. 

### If taken again, what would you have done better? 

I changed the application so that the user can enter a specific amount and get the corresponding USD amount. However, I did not enforce the user to enter an integer. If the user enter a float, this app will also return the corresponding USD amount for the integer part. If try again, I would like to check whether the user entering an integer to avoid the above situation.
